# practical-machine-learning-course-project
This is a course project I did as part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) on Coursera for the [Practical Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn).

It is a classifier for detecting proper form in weight lifting exercises based on data from [PUC Rio](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). It makes these predictions based on accelerometer data from several sensors worn by the user.  For more information, see the original paper.

The R Markdown output can be found on Github Pages  [here](http://timothy055.github.io/practical-machine-learning-course-project/classifier.html)
